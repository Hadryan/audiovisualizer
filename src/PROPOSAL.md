**CS 126 Project Proposal: Audio Visualization**
* By Simran Desai

**Overview:**
* For my final project, I would like to create a visualization of the frequencies of a song
and display them on the screen. 

**Description:**
* I plan to create an audio visualizer that allows the user to input a song of choice 
upon which an animation reacts to the beat of the music. The floating animation will simply be a collection of dots 
that  move randomly in a concentrated area centered on the screen and connect via a line once they encounter a 
certain distance from each other. At the same time, an audio visualizer will exist at the bottom of the screen in 
the form of bars that rise and fall based on the capturing of the frequencies or beats of the audio being played. 

**Features Implementation:**
* Some of the features I plan to include are the options to change the song and the ability for the size and pace
of the dots as well as the heights of the bars to vary based on frequency levels of the audio.
