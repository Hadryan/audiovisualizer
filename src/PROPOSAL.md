**CS 126 Project Proposal: Audio Visualization**
By Simran Desai

Overview:
For my final project, I would like to create a visualization of the frequencies of a song
and display them on the screen. 

Description:
I plan to create a floating wave visualizer that allows the user to input a song of choice 
upon which an animation "floats" to the beat of the music.
At the same time, an audio visualizer will exist in the background to capture the frequencies or beats
of the music being played. The floating wave will simply be a collection of dots that  move randomly 
in a concentrated area and connect via a line once they encounter a certain distance from each other. 

Features Implementation:
Some of the features I plan to include are the options to change the song and the background image 
as well as the the ability for the brghtness and band colors to vary based on frequency levels of the audio.


Libraries:
I plan to use the following libraries:
ofSoundPlayer (http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/sound/ofSoundPlayer/)
ofImage (http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofImage/)
