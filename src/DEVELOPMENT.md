**Audio Visualizer**
	- **Development - Rough Checkpoints:**
			1. Week 1 Code Review: Add .jpg backgroud image and .wav sound files. Working implementation of at
			least one component of the visualizer i.e. floating dots animation in the foreground.
			2. Week 2 Code Review: Implementation of background bars that rise and fall based on audio frequency.
			More visually pleasing interface, brightness and bar colors vary based on audio frequency. Overall, nicer application.
