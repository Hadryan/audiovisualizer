**Audio Visualizer**
	- **Development - Rough Checkpoints:**
			1. Week 1 Code Review: Add .jpg backgroud image and .wav sound files. Working implementation of at
			least one component of the visualizer i.e. floating dots animation in the foreground.
			2. Week 2 Code Review: Implementation of background bars that rise and fall based on audio frequency.
			More visually pleasing interface, brightness and bar colors vary based on audio frequency. Overall, nicer application. 

	- **Development Process** 
			- Problem: Unable to draw circles to represent the dots in the foreground animation.
			- Solution: Had to use new library and its methods. Specifically, had to use the ofCircle method
			implementation from the Graphics library to assist in creating circles.
